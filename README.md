# Disease Risk Prediction using Natural Language Processing

## Course: NLP (Semester 6) - Pillai College of Engineering

### Project Overview:

This project is part of the **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** course for **Semester 6** students at **Pillai College of Engineering**. The project focuses on **Disease Risk Prediction**, where we apply various **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and **Language Models** to classify individuals into high-risk or low-risk categories based on health records, behaviors, and genetic predispositions. This involves exploring techniques such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation to assess the effectiveness of different models in predicting disease risk and improving personalized healthcare recommendations.

## Project Title: 
### Disease Risk Prediction using Natural Language Processing

## Project Abstract:
Natural language processing (NLP) techniques enable disease risk prediction by analyzing unstructured clinical narratives from patient records, extracting health metrics (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI) and behavioral factors (e.g., smoking, diet, physical activity). This approach classifies individuals into high- or low-risk categories, transforming textual data into actionable insights for personalized treatment planning, preventive strategies, and efficient healthcare resource allocation. By leveraging diverse narrative patient profiles, NLP-driven risk stratification demonstrates potential to improve patient outcomes and enhance diagnostic accuracy and public health monitoring.


## Algorithms Used:

-  Machine Learning algorithms:
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Logistic Regression 
   - Random Forest
 
- Deep Learning algorithms:
  - Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

 - Language Models:
      - RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT apporach)
      - distillBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

## Comparative Analysis:
The comparative analysis of different models highlights their effectiveness in classifying individuals into the correct disease risk category (high-risk or low-risk).
The following table summarizes the **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** of the models tested:

## Conclusion:
This Disease Risk Prediction study demonstrates the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in transforming unstructured clinical narratives into actionable insights. By analyzing patient records to extract health metrics such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and BMI, alongside behavioral factors like smoking, diet, and physical activity, the approach successfully classifies individuals into high- and low-risk categories. Comparative evaluation reveals that advanced NLP models significantly outperform traditional methods in accuracy, precision, and recall, enabling personalized treatment planning and preventive care strategies. The findings underscore the transformative potential of NLP-driven risk stratification in improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare resource allocation.
